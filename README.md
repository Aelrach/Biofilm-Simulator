# Biofilm-Simulator
Project aimed at programming an individual based model (cellular automaton approach) for modeling bacterial biofilms and interactions within them. 
It was created for the end of the one month UP-09 'Ingénierie par simulation numérique' course of AgroParisTech engineering school.
Every function and parameter is explained in the comments of the code which you can freely download in the section above.
You will also find my project report to help understand the why and the how of this project.

# Use
1) Download code
2) Set the working directory to the desired path on your device. (line 48)
3) You can launch the simulation with the given parameters to see how it works
4) To understand each parameter, I highly recommend to read the documentation of appropriate functions.
5) The project's report I gave for final evaluation is available in both french and english and can be helpful to understand what was done and why.

# Disclaimer
I do not recommend launching in 3D mode with more than 50x50x50 space.
