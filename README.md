# Biofilm-Simulator
Project aimed at programming an individual based model (cellular automaton approach) for modeling bacterial biofilms and interactions within them. 
It was created for the end of the one month UP-09 'Ingénierie par simulation numérique' course of AgroParisTech engineering school.
Every function and parameter is explained in the comments of the code.
You will also find my project report to help understand the why and the how of this project.
